# Partial Diff

## Features

* You can compare (diff) text selections within a file, across different files, or to the clipboard.
* Multi cursor text selection
* User defined text normalisation rules to reduce the noise in the diff (e.g. replace tab characters to spaces)

![Compare two text selections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryu1kn/vscode-partial-diff/master/images/public.gif)

## Commands

* `Select Text for Compare`: Marks the selected text as the text to compare the next selection with.
* `Compare Text with Previous Selection`: Compares the selected text to the first selection.
* `Compare Text with Clipboard`: Compares the current clipboard to the selected text.

**NOTE:**

* A diff will be shown only after selecting comparison text first (using `Select Text for Compare`).
* Executing the `Select Text for Compare` or `Compare Text with Previous Selection` command without selecting any text will use the entire text of the current file.

## Configurations

* `partialDiff.preComparisonTextNormalizationRules`: Rules to normalize texts for diff view.

    It doesn't mutate texts in the editors. Only texts in diff views get normalised.
    If a diff is presented with text normalised (or possibly normalised), `~` is used in the diff title instead of `â†”`)

    Each rule has `match`, `replaceWith` and optionally `name`.

    * `name`: Optional. Name of the rule to describe what the rule is for.
    * `match`: Regular expression to find text you want to normalise. [Global search flag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=JavaScript%2FGuide%2FRegular_Expressions#Advanced_searching_with_flags) is automatically applied.
    * `replaceWith`: One of the following
      * **Replacement text** as a string. You can use `$N`, where `N` is the index of substring (starting from 1) you captured in `match` with `()`.
      * **Letter case specification** as an object. Valid cases are `upper` and `lower`.

    Sample `preComparisonTextNormalizationRules`:

    ```
    "partialDiff.preComparisonTextNormalizationRules": [
      {
        "name": "Replace tabs with whitespaces",
        "match": "\t",
        "replaceWith": "  "
      },
      {
        "name": "One space after comma",
        "match": ", *([^,\n]+)",
        "replaceWith": ", $1"
      },
      {
        "name": "Capitalise",
        "match": ".*",
        "replaceWith": {"letterCase": "upper"}
      }
      ...
    ]
    ```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

You can quickly mark the selected text by adding the `partial-diff` commands to your keyboard shortcut settings. For example:

```json
  { "key": "ctrl+1", "command": "extension.partialDiff.markSection1",
                        "when": "editorTextFocus" },
  { "key": "ctrl+2", "command": "extension.partialDiff.markSection2AndTakeDiff",
                        "when": "editorTextFocus" },
  { "key": "ctrl+3", "command": "extension.partialDiff.diffSelectionWithClipboard",
                        "when": "editorTextFocus" },
```

## Known problems

* If you want to compare text in Output channels, you'll need to execute the commands via keyboard shortcuts or the context menu (i.e. right-click menu). Executing the commands through the command palette doesn't work. See [Cannot compare texts in Outputs channel if the mark text commands are executed from the command palette](https://github.com/ryu1kn/vscode-partial-diff/issues/3).
